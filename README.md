# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub

I'm Tyler and I am trying to learn teach myself to code in Python. I don't have a set of defined goals yet. Ideally I would be more productive at work (currently we do everything in excel although I have self-taught the basics of SQL and querying system data instead of using canned reports) and also to build fun projects at home.
